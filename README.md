# Neural Network From Scratch in NumPy

This project implements a simple feedforward neural network using only NumPy, without any high-level deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## Project Overview

- A basic neural network with one hidden layer.
- Sigmoid activation function.
- Training using backpropagation.
- Vectorized input and output from a small knowledge base (brain.json).
- Includes a simple chatbot interface to interact and teach the AI.

## Features

- Understanding core concepts of neural networks by building from scratch.
- Training a network on custom data stored in JSON.
- Real-time learning with user input.
- Implemented fully in Python with NumPy.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/illinoiss/brain-nn-numpy-ai.git
